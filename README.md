- 👋 Hi, I’m @nellof623, Started coding in 1982 on a Radio Shack TRS-80 in Basic (Just missed the punch card generation...whew!)... After college, and my first gig (my past life) (80'-90's) wrote in Assembly for the 808x chip set families, Device drivers (*.SYS for the OG's out there),  Back End Communication Software using/developing propietary protocols (DOS,Windows NT). Quit coding for 10 years, but picked it up again in 2007, several years after Dot Net was released and wrote for  three more years, primarily automated Trading (Stocks/Options) software. 
Just downloaded Dot Net Pre Visual Studio, my third iteration joining the software development world ... my how things have changed!


- 👀 I’m interested in Writing in Dot Net, in particular the MAUI class. This looks really interesting and think that that the ability to develope cross platform applications in one enviornment, mulitple languages is a game changer. I want to understand it, having problems with Android Emulators, want to be proficient.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning, re-learning Dot Net IDE.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... When i learn something will be happy to share and teach.
